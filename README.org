#+title: README
* Overview
This project demonstrates an [[https://nasa.github.io/fprime/][fprime]] powered flight software deployment which leverages state machines and other MBSE type models to generate code.

** Getting Started
*** Dependencies
The project is containerized with Docker, ensuring compatibility across various environments including Ubuntu and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Before proceeding, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- [[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git][Git]] (For cloning the repository)
- [[https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/][Docker]] (For running the software)

[[https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/][Ensure Docker is configured to run without ~sudo~ in your environment]]
*** Setting up the repo
**** Clone the repo and submodules
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#Get the repo
git clone git@github.com:ReggieMarr/MBSE_FSW.git
cd MBSE_FSW
#pull in the submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive
#+END_SRC

** Example Usage
The flight software ships with a script run.sh  which can be used to simplify development and interaction with this repo's assets.
Commands are summarized as such:

#+begin_src plantuml :file .org_out/run.png :tangle .org_out/run.puml :exports results

The script supports a number of useful commands.
Tab completion is enabled by entering the following:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
source .gen-run-complete.sh
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
❯ ./run.sh --help
Usage: run.sh [OPTIONS] COMMAND

Options:
  --daemon             Run as daemon
  --debug              Enable debug mode
  --as-host            Run as host
  --persist            Ignore startup issues and keep running
  --local              Use local environment
  --clean              Clean build
  --host-thread-ctl    Set thread control
  --help               Show this help message

Commands:
  docker-build         Build the Docker image
  build                Build the project
  inspect [container]  Inspect a container
  exec                 Execute the FlightComputer
  gds                  Run the GDS
  update               Pulls the latest version of docker images
  sync                 Pushes local changes and updates docker images
  gen-deps             Generate dependencies (for editor mapping)
  teardown             Tear down the environment
  test                 Run tests
  topology             Generate topology visualization
#+END_SRC

One use case is building and running the deployment, this can be done like so (note building clean is only necessary when making significant changes):
#+begin_src bash
❯ ./run.sh build --clean && ./run.sh exec --local
#+end_src

This then provides a web based ui that can be viewed by visiting http://127.0.0.1:5000/#Channels on your preferred web browser.

*Note* this example runs a standard version of ~fprime-gds~ and deploys it locally.
More information about the Web UI can be found [[https://nasa.github.io/fprime/UsersGuide/gds/gds-introduction.html][here]].
*** Additional Tips
   - Combine flags: ~./run.sh --clean --debug exec~
   - Script uses environment variables from .env file in the same directory
   - Use ~--daemon~ flag to run processes in the background
   - Use ~--host-thread-ctl~ when building for non-sudo host execution thread control

   Note: Ensure proper permissions and Docker setup before running commands.

* Flight Sequence State Machine
The following state machine is fed as input to [[https://github.com/JPLOpenSource/STARS][STARS]] which then generates ~fpp~ and ~c++~ as output.

#+BEGIN_SRC plantuml :tangle ./FlightSoftware/FlightSequencer/FlightSM.plantuml :exports both :file .org_out/FlightSM.svg
@startuml

[*] --> IDLE:  /initFlightStatus()

state IDLE {
}

state IN_FLIGHT {
    [*] --> FIRING
    IN_FLIGHT:Entry: initFlightStatus()
    'FIXME consolidate this and the TBURN interval
    IN_FLIGHT:Internal: UPDATE_INTERVAL/updateFlightStatus()

    state FIRING {
        FIRING:Entry: engageThrust()
    }
    state GLIDING {
        GLIDING:Entry: disengageThrust()
        GLIDING:Internal: UPDATE_INTERVAL/updateFlightStatus(); checkLowAltReached()
    }
    'NOTE this should probably be replaced by an event
    'but we wanted to play with conditions here
    state tBurnCheck <<choice>>
    FIRING --> tBurnCheck: TBURN_CHECK_INTERVAL
    tBurnCheck --> GLIDING: [isTBurnReached()]

}

IDLE --> IN_FLIGHT: IGNITE
IN_FLIGHT --> IDLE: TERMINATE
